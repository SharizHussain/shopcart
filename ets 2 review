Fabulous Fire Fantastic ! Best Simulation game I have ever played. One of the best graphics it has in gaming industry and specially vehicle focused games. We can easily play it in low end(in Low to Medium graphics) to high end (High and Ultra graphics) PCs. Base Game is also super enjoyable and if you'll buy it's map expansion DLCs, accessories packs, paint job packs, special transport and many more DLCs, if you have enough money then this game can become a giant gigantic game. In steam there are sales many times, you can take advantage of that golden opportunity and can save lots of money because there are really big discounts sometimes. And I think this game has a bright future because there are lots of new features, new exiting things and new role play stuffs are coming to this game, And hope virtual trucking world things and that all. Hope it's Hope of fans and may it become reality. Overall ! FANTABULOUS GAME.
